***Companies should move forward with an endpoint protection plan for securing and protecting user endpoints, this applies to our laptops or machines used daily for completing company related work.***

***The purpose of endpoint is to secure from planned attacks and advanced fixed threats that can't be prevented with our local anti-virus solutions alone. The Endpoint solution also provides backup to restore  the hard disk if the option is applicable to the user machine.***   

***Generally working from an office environment, each user would be in a domain with security rules or Group policies along with a firewall in place to help secure the company network. It would prevent user machines with unwanted applications or malware that can compromise company operations. Also when employees are facing device/software issues the IT team would be able to look into the issues and fix them in person. Working from home makes it difficult to track all information individually and help the team with their IT needs, especially if there isn't a unified management system. Since we are no longer in an office environment we don't benefit from those features , therefore we are going to cover the gaps and mitigate the risks by implementing the endpoint protection plan.***

***The nature of the endpoint protection is to track all activities to monitor for suspicious activity or known threats. Reporting by default will only show security risks. The intent is not to monitor a user's web history or files, it's simply to secure infrastructure, and make sure there is no malicious activity taking place and be able to help our team remotely when needed.***

***By default the policy is not blocking anything except malicious sites and nothing is being reported, we will only know which sites have been visited if they have been blocked for safety.***


### The Endpoint protection does the following, but not limited to:


- Advance Security: Detect threats and other types of suspicious behavior on the user machine. 

- RMM: Gain information about machine health, status, and checkpoints

- Remote access to your machine (like team viewer).

- Backup if optioned for that machine.

- Backup of email and documents.

- Security awareness training.




## FAQ

### How does it work ?
